    "Sometimes you need to plot your data with a logarithmic scale. As an example, let's consider the classic genetic switch engineered by Jim Collins and coworkers ([Gardner, et al., *Nature*, **403**, 339, 2000](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v403/n6767/full/403339a0.html)). This genetic switch was incorporated into *E. coli* and is inducible by adjusting the concentration of the lactose analog IPTG. The readout is the fluorescence intensity of GFP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's load in some data that have the IPTG concentrations and GFP fluorescence intensity. The data are in the file `~/git/data/collins_switch.csv`. Let's look at it."

In fact, looking at the data set, the concentration of IPTG varies over four orders of magnitude. When you have data like this, it is wise to plot them on a logarithmic scale. You can specify the x-axis as logarithmic when you instantiate a figure with `bokeh.plotting.figure()` by using the `x_axis_type='log'` kwarg. (The obvious analogous kwarg applied for the y-axis.) For this data set, it is definitely best to have the x-axis on a logarithmic scale. Remake the plot you just did with the x-axis logarithmically scaled.\n",
